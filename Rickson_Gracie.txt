Biography[edit]
Rickson Gracie, son of Helio Gracie, received his black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu at age 18.[citation needed] At 20, Gracie won his first victory against the famous 230-pound (104 kg) Brazilian brawler Rei Zulu (father of Zuluzinho). With this victory, Rickson gained immediate national acclaim. Five years later Zulu requested a rematch and lost to Rickson again, in Maracanazinho before an audience of 20,000 spectators.[citation needed]
Rickson also famously fought luta livre exponent Hugo Duarte on the Rio de Janeiro beach. Duarte only wanted to fight in an event, but Gracie slapped him in front of his students and challenged him again, so Hugo stepped down and faced Rickson on the sand. Gracie won after making him surrender to punches to the face.[8] Shortly after, maintaining that Gracie students had kicked him and thrown sand to his eyes during the fight, Duarte came to Rickson's gym and demanded a rematch. Gracie won again, causing a riot which forced neighbours to call the police. Shortly after, Royler Gracie challenged Eugenio Tadeu, another luta livre practitioner, and the two fought to a 50 minute draw.[8] The rivalry between Brazilian jiu-jitsu and luta livre continued without Rickson, as he left Brazil for United States after the fight.
